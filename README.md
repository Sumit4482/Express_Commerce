## Adding a New Endpoint

To add a new endpoint to the Express_Commerce API, follow these steps:

1. Define the route and HTTP method in the appropriate route file (e.g., `productRoutes.js`, `cartRoutes.js`, etc.).
2. Create a corresponding controller function in the `controllers` directory to handle the logic for the new endpoint.
3. Implement any necessary services or helper functions in the `services` directory.
4. Test the new endpoint thoroughly to ensure it functions as expected.
5. Update the `README.md` file to document the new endpoint, including its route, purpose, and any required parameters or payloads.
